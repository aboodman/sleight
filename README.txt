Support for transparency in PNG images was not implemented in Windows IE until
version 7. This library implements support for PNGs in Windows IE 5.5 and 6.

To use Sleight, you need to drop the sleight.js file in the head of your
document. Then make images with PNGs as the source:

<img src="foo.png" />

That's all.
